# AirCursor

Welcome to the code of no_contact.
Ever wondered - I feel lazy to make my hands reach the mouse. Now worry not. Clone this repo into your system and gain contactless control over your machine.

Below says the gestures which are currently functional -
1. Pointer movement - Upbring the Index finger of your right hand and control the mouse pointer.
2. Scroll - Upbring both Index and Middle finger of your right hand and drag up/down to scroll accordingly.
3. Left Click - Left hand turning from open-hand to fist triggers Left click.
4. Close/ Exit - Get your both index fingers together - and you are out of program.

This code is still under construction - and you can definately mail me your suggestions on my mail - patelrajdeep002@gmail.com
